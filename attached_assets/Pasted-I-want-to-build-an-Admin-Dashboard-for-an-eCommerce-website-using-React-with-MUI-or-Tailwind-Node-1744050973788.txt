I want to build an Admin Dashboard for an eCommerce website using React (with MUI or Tailwind), Node.js (or Firebase), and MongoDB/PostgreSQL.

Please generate the structure, components, routes, and database models for the following modules:

---

🧩 1. Dashboard (Admin Overview)
- Display stats: total sales, active customers, total orders, pending refunds, top-selling products.
- Include charts for sales trends, revenue breakdown, and recent activity.

---

📦 2. Products Tab
- Product List Page: searchable, filterable table with actions (edit, delete, view reviews).
- Create Product Page: form with fields like name, price, stock, description, categories, brand, images.
- Product Reviews Page: view & moderate customer reviews for all products.

---

🗂 3. Categories (Infinitely Nested)
- Category List Page: display nested structure with expand/collapse.
- Create Category Page: form to add name, slug, parent category.

---

🏷 4. Brands Tab
- Brand List Page: list all brands with logo and product count.
- Create Brand Page: name, logo upload, description.

---

📦 5. Orders Tab
- Order List Page: searchable/filterable with status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered).
- Order Details Page: show customer info, product breakdown, delivery status, and total.

---

👥 6. Customers Page
- List customers with name, email, order count, registration date.

---

💸 7. Refunds Tab
- Refund Requests Page: list with order, reason, status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
- Refund Settings Page: configure refund rules, time limits, and policies.

---

🎟 8. Support Tickets
- Support Tickets Page: table with ticket ID, customer, issue type, status, reply action.

---

⚙️ 9. Site Settings Page
- Configure the customer-facing site (logo, primary colors, contact info, policies, homepage layout).

---

🎯 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + MUI or Tailwind + React Router
- Backend: Node.js + Express (or Firebase Functions)
- DB: postgresql
- Auth: Firebase Auth or JWT

Generate:
- Folder structure
- All route paths for frontend
- API endpoints
- Database schema
- Components layout
- Sample data

Make the UI modern and modular — similar to Shopify or Bazaar Dashboard.
